# pyRePKG
This is a tool to depackage Wallpaper Engine `*.pkg` files.

## Requirements
Python 3.8+

## Quick Start
Before running, check `paths.txt`, and (see demo in the repository):
put package directories built by Steam into `srcFiles`. 
`extractedFile` is the temporary storage directory. No need to replace it unless you want to see the extracted packages.
`savedPics` is the directory to save output images.

Note: modify those **directories** in **Windows path format**!

Then double click `launch.exe` to start the tool.

Just enjoy it!
