# pyRePKG
This is a tool to depackage Wallpaper Engine `*.pkg` files.

## Requirements
Python 3.8+

## Usage
Before run, check `paths.txt`, and replace (default by test file):

`srcFiles` as packages root built by Steam. 
`extractedFile` as temporarily saving file. No need to replace it unless you want to see the extracted package.
`savedPics` as directory to save output images.

Note: modify those **directories** in **Windows path format**!

Then double click `launch.exe` to operate.

Enjoy!
